# HireMail AI 🚀
**AI  powered Job Application Platform*

HireMail AI is a production-grade system that automates the end-to-end job application workflow — from reading job descriptions to tailoring resumes and cover letters, and finally submitting applications via Gmail. Built for speed, reliability, and precision, the system is designed to give job seekers a measurable edge while preserving security and privacy.

## Why this exists
Applying to many roles usually means repeating the same manual steps: dissecting a job description, aligning your experience to required skills, rewriting sections, proofreading, and sending emails. That process works — but it’s slow and error prone.

HireMail AI automates that pipeline using modern Generative AI techniques so you can apply faster, more accurately, and at scale — while keeping full control over what gets sent.

## Highlights / Impact
- **Multi-agent architecture** that decomposes the job-application workflow into specialized agents.  
- **Auto-Diagnostic Agent** that detects and corrects runtime issues autonomously — improving system reliability by **~60%**.  
- **LLM Factory Handler** for cost- and accuracy-aware routing across multiple model providers (OpenAI, Mistral, Gemini, Hugging Face Hub).  

---

## What it does (user flow)
1. Upload your existing resume (PDF).  
2. Provide job details: role title, company name, recruiter email, and JD (or link).  
3. System analyzes the JD, extracts required skills and terminology, and rewrites relevant resume sections to match the role.  
4. Generates a concise, tailored cover letter.  
5. Composes the application email and sends attachments through Gmail API — all with minimal manual steps.

## Core components (high level)
- **Resume Tailoring Agent** — parses resume + JD, aligns language, highlights matching achievements.  
- **Cover Letter Agent** — creates role-specific, recruiter-friendly letters.  
- **Email Agent** — formats message, manages Gmail OAuth flow, and queues sends.  
- **Auto-Diagnostic Agent** — runtime monitor, automated remediation, retry logic, and prompt consistency checks.  
- **LLM Factory Handler** — dynamic model selection (latency/cost/accuracy tradeoffs), fallback and failover policies.  
- **Vector Search (FAISS)** — semantic matching for skills and past projects

## Reliability & Engineering notes
- Self-healing behavior via the Auto-Diagnostic Agent reduces manual ops and increases uptime.  
- Cost/latency optimization through the LLM Factory Handler enables using smaller, cheaper models where appropriate and switching to higher-capacity models for complex tasks.  
- Sensitive credentials and user data are handled with environment isolation and OAuth — production deployment includes secrets management and audit logging.

## Why repository is private
The codebase and low-level optimizations are intentionally private while the service is being launched and hardened.

If you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or technical collaborator and want a deeper look — I’m happy to share architecture diagrams, design notes, or a controlled demo.

## Next steps (if opening up or collaboration requested)
- Provide sanitized architecture diagram & component interactions.  
- Share API contract for agent interactions (high-level).  
- Offer an invitation for an NDA-backed code review or a recorded walkthrough for interested recruiters/partners.
